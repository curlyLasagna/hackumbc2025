# Adoptly

Adoptly is a natural-language interface that helps people discover adoptable pets who are waiting for a loving, forever home. Instead of wrestling with rigid dropdowns and forms, users can simply type what they’re looking for—like “Show me a playful kitten near Baltimore” or “Find an older dog that’s good with kids.” We translate everyday requests into structured searches against Petfinder’s listings, surfacing pets that fit a user’s lifestyle and preferences. By lowering the barrier to discovery, Adoptly helps shelters connect animals with the right adopters faster—and gives every pet a better chance to be seen, not filtered out.

By lowering the barrier to discovery, the platform makes it easier for shelters to connect animals with potential adopters, and for people to find their perfect companion. At its heart, the project is about empathy and accessibility: giving every pet a better chance at finding their forever family, and every adopter a more human, intuitive way to search.
