# Adoptly

A natural language interface that helps people discover adoptable pets who are waiting for a loving home. Instead of filtering through rigid dropdowns or forms, users can simply type or speak what they’re looking for—like “Show me a playful kitten near Baltimore” or “Find an older dog that’s good with kids.” The system translates these everyday requests into structured searches across adoption databases, surfacing pets that match the user’s lifestyle and preferences. By lowering the barrier to discovery, the platform makes it easier for shelters to connect animals with potential adopters, and for people to find their perfect companion. At its heart, the project is about empathy and accessibility: giving every pet a better chance at finding their forever family, and every adopter a more human, intuitive way to search.
